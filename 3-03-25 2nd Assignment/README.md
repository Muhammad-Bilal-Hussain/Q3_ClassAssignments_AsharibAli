Class #2 Assignment #2 - Python Operators

This folder contains a Python script demonstrating the practical use of various Python operators. Below is a summary of what each section covers:

1. Arithmetic Operators

Performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division.

2. Assignment Operators

Using assignment operators to assign and modify values, including combined operations like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, and **=.

3. Bitwise Operators

Working with binary representations of numbers and applying bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, LEFT SHIFT, and RIGHT SHIFT.

4. Comparison Operators

Comparing values with operators like ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <= to return Boolean results.

5. Logical Operators

Using logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) to evaluate multiple conditions.

6. Identity Operators

Checking whether two variables point to the same memory location using 'is' and 'is not'.

7. Membership Operators

Checking whether an element exists in a sequence (like a list) using 'in' and 'not in'.

8. Admin Name Check

A small program that takes user input and checks if the entered name is in the list of admin names.

How to Run the Script

Ensure you have Python installed.

Save the script as operators_assignment.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the script folder.

Run the command:

python operators_assignment.py

Follow the prompts and view the results directly in the terminal.

This assignment covers almost all core Python operators, making it a great hands-on practice to understand how operators work in Python.
